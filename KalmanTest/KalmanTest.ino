So one of the major issues with ultrasonic sensors is that we tend to get spikes in the measured distances,
This can sometimes happen due to the object in question not being wide enough and so the values can jump around significantly.
In order to solve this problem, we need to use a low pass filter. A simple implementation of a low pass filter would be to 
take a weighted average of the new distance and the old distance. The problem with this approach is that this works well only 
in some situations and isn't "adaptive".
So how do we solve this? Well, one way of solving this is to say "the more realistic the change in the reading appears to be, 
the more we can trust it" (which is I guess a one line definition of a kalman filter but whatever). The next question then is,
what do you mean by a realistic change? Well the answer is simple. The change is within some physical bounds. So lets say for
example that the ultrasonic sensor is mounted on a rover (car like thing). The rover can at most move at say 10 m/s (damn fast
for a rover eh?). Another thing to consider is that while the rover can move at 10m/s, the probability that it reaches that 
speed in less than 100ms is quite low (10g's of acceleration). So I guess you could use the estimated acceleration as a means
for determining how much you should trust the reading. Now if I had an accelerometer mounted on that rover I could probably also 
compare the 2 things but that isn't the case so we'll make do with what we have.

The idea is that while the rover can accelerate at 1g, the probability that it actually does is not very high, at least
not as high as the probability that the rover moves at a roughly constant speed with some variations.
